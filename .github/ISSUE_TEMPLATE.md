Thanks for creating an issue on the MultiQC repository!

## If you're reporting a bug..
Please paste the full log message that you get, surrounded by
three back-ticks on either side to make a code block:
```
your error log here
```
If the problem is intermittent, please also attach some example
log files which trigger the problem. Without this, it will be very
tricky for me to replicate the issue and fix the bug.

## If you're requesting a new module
Please attach some example log file output - without this I won't
write the module. If possible, log files from different scenarios
helps (eg. paired end and single end data). You can either drag
and drop the files onto the issue, or paste them into a code block:
```
log file output here
```

It helps if you mention which bits of information are the most useful
to you. For example, a single value to put into the General Statistics
table at the top and/or data to plot in a graph.

## If you're requesting a new feature
Great! Fire away :)
