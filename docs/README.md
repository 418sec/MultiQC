# MultiQC Documentation

You've found the MultiQC docs, nice! These are written in markdown and
are bundled with the source code for easier access.

Whilst the raw markdown looks lovely (especially on GitHub), you may prefer
to view these docs on the [MultiQC website](http://multiqc.info),
where they are rendered into an aesthetically pleasing website for
your delectation: [http://multiqc.info](http://multiqc.info)

If you'd rather stick with the raw docs, here's what's available:

- [Docs homepage](index.md)
- [Installation and usage](installation.md)
- [Getting started writing modules](writing_modules.md)
- [Python helpers](writing_python.md)
- [Javascript helpers](writing_javascript.md)

If you're curious how the website works, check out the
[MultiQC website repository](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC_website).
