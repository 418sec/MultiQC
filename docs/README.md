 - Using MultiQC
   - [Installing MultiQC](installation.md)
   - [Running MultiQC](usage.md)
   - [Using Reports](reports.md)
   - [Configuration](config.md)
 - MultiQC Modules

These docs can be read in any of three ways:
 - On the MultiQC Website: http://multiqc.info
 - On GitHub: https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/
 - As part of the distributed source code (in `/docs/`)
 
If you're curious how the website works, check out the

## Contributing to MultiQC

If you write a module which could be of use to others, it would be great to
merge those changes back into the core MultiQC project.

For instructions on how best to do this, please see the
[contributing instructions](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
