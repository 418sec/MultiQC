# Welcome!
## MultiQC v0.2 Documentation
MultiQC is a tool to aggregate bioinformatics results across many samples
into a single report. It's written in Python and contains modules for a number
of common tools.

This documentation covers the basics of [installing and using MultiQC](installation.md).
It also has in-depth descriptions of how [new modules](writing_modules.md)
should be added to MultiQC, along with the helper [Python](writing_python.md)
and [Javascript](writing_javascript.md) functions that are provided to make
your life easier.

## Contributing to Cluster Flow
If you write a module which could be of use to others, it would be great to
merge those changes back into the core MultiQC project.

For instructions on how best to do this, please see the
[contributing instructions](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
