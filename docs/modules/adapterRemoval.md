Name: Adapter Removal
URL: https://github.com/mikkelschubert/adapterremoval
Description: >
    This program searches for and removes remnant adapter sequences from 
    High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality 
    bases from the 3' end of reads following adapter removal. 
    AdapterRemoval can analyze both single end and paired end data, 
    and can be used to merge overlapping paired-ended reads into 
    (longer) consensus sequences. Additionally, the AdapterRemoval may be 
    used to recover a consensus adapter sequence for paired-ended data, 
    for which this information is not available.

The adapterRemoval module parses `*.settings` logs generated by
[Adapter Removal](https://github.com/mikkelschubert/adapterremoval),
a tool for rapid adapter trimming, identification, and read merging.

supported setting file results:

* `single end`
* `paired end noncollapsed`
* `paired end collapsed`
