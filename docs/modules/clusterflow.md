Cluster Flow is a simple and flexible bioinformatics pipeline tool.
It's designed to be quick and easy to install, with flexible configuration
and simple customization.

Cluster Flow easy enough to set up and use for non-bioinformaticians
(given a basic knowledge of the command line), and it's simplicity
makes it great for low to medium throughput analyses.

The MultiQC module for Cluster Flow parses `*_clusterflow.txt` run logs
and finds commands executed by modules. These are saved in
`multiqc_data/multiqc_clusterflow.txt` and consensus commands are
shown in the report.
