Name: goleft indexcov
URL: https://github.com/brentp/goleft/tree/master/indexcov
Description: >
    Quickly estimate coverage from a whole-genome bam index, providing 16KB resolution.
    This is useful as a quick QC to get coverage values across the genome.

The goleft indexcov module parses results generated by 
[goleft indexcov](https://github.com/brentp/goleft/tree/master/indexcov),
creating plots of coverage and regions covered by scaled depth. It requires
post-processing goleft indexcov output to rename the generated `*-indexcov.bed.gz`
files to `*-indexcov.tsv` for correct uptake by MultiQC.
