Description: >
    This tool performs screening of output from the ancient DNA optimised 
    BLAST-replacement tool MALT, to identify taxa that have expected ancient 
    DNA characteristics.

This module takes the JSON output of the HOPS postprocessing R script, to
recreate the possible positives heatmap, with the heat intensity representing
the number of 'ancient DNA characteristics' categories that a particular
taxa has.
