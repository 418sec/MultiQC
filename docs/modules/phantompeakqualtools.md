Description: >

    Phantompeakqualtools computes informative enrichment and quality measures for ChIP-seq/DNase-seq/FAIRE-seq/MNase-seq data. It can also be used to obtain robust estimates of the predominant fragment length or characteristic tag shift values in these assays.

Used to generate three quality metrics: NSC, RSC, and PBC. The NSC (Normalized strand cross-correlation) and RSC (relative strand cross-correlation) metrics use cross-correlation of stranded read density profiles to measure enrichment independently of peak calling. The PBC (PCR bottleneck coefficient) is an approximate measure of library complexity. PBC is the ratio of (non-redundant, uniquely mappable reads)/(uniquely mappable reads).
