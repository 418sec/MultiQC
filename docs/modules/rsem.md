[RSEM](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/),
a software package for estimating gene and isoform expression levels 
from RNA-Seq data

Supported scripts:

* `rsem-calculate-expression`

You can choose to hide sections of RSEL output and customise their order.
To do this, add and customise the following to your MultiQC config file:

```yaml
sp:
    rsem:
        contents: 'rsem version'
```

Change the order to rearrage sections or remove to hide them from the report.
