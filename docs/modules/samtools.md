The Samtools module parses results generated by
[Samtools](http://www.htslib.org),
a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput
sequencing data.

Please note that `samtools idxstats` prints its results to standard
out (no consistent file name) and has no header lines or anything
(no way to recognise from content of file). As such, `idxstats`
result files must have the string `idxstat` somewhere in the filename.
